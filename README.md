## Self Assessment

### My time in the computer science program has allowed me to hone my strengths and develop new skills which align with my goals in the field of computer science. The program introduced me to applied subjects such as computational visualization, machine learning, data visualization, and cyber security.  The stated examples are areas which I have pursued at length beyond their original courses, and which have helped shape my goals toward ones of data science for research and of cyber security for offensive security. These subjects relevant to data science have allowed me to develop a functional and theoretical understanding of many of the computational concepts required to be successful in the career of research.

### These data science concepts, by necessity, required developing a deep understanding of theoretical computation, allowing for the development of an intuitive understanding of the most important data structures and algorithms in computation. My focus on cyber security aided with this, as defensive and offensive security both require deep understandings of data structures and algorithms in order to prevent attacks or exploit programs respectively.
                
### Throughout this journey, I learned much more than applied and theoretical computational concepts. Over these years of study, it became imperative to advance my collaboration skills to be able to succeed in a team environment. Working with others improved the readability and extensibility of all of my projects, as it was required for effective collaboration and communication. Because of this, I am now able to easily resume work on old projects because of the effort put into developing work in a way which easily communicates ideas to anyone working on said work. Additionally, it has been easy for those with whom I have worked to work with and modify my programs.

### In order to more effectively collaborate with others, I have often employed the agile scrum methodology, keeping development orderly, incremental, and well planned.

### In developing these communication skills, I also developed skills relevant to communicating with share holders, learning how to efficiently turn business goals into code, and communicating about any gaps or inconsistencies in requested outcomes.

### The computer science program involved a large amount of software engineering practice, which has been applied at length in my previously mentioned engagements with computational visualization, machine learning, data visualization, and cyber security, the first three of which required a well developed understanding of databases, in order to have efficient and effective data solutions.

### In order to demonstrate these abilities, I have chosen to modify two artifacts from previous courses which represent my abilities to employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making; to develop solutions using algorithmic principles and computer science best practices; to employ well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices; and to employ a security mindset that anticipates exploits and ensures privacy and security.

### These two artifacts have been modified from their original forms according to three categories. Software design and engineering, databases, and data structures and algorithms.

### For the areas of software design and engineering and databases, I have chosen a previously developed phone application called Inventory Manager. This app was chosen as it displayed knowledge in multiple technologies while also providing opportunities to show growth in both software design and engineering and databases.

### For the area of data structures and algorithms, I have chosen a previously developed final project for my data structures and algorithms course. This project was a binary search tree implementation which recorded the speeds of various algorithms. Using this basis, in order to show off the ability to construct and use complex data structures, I have set out to construct a data structure comparator though the implementation of various data structures.

### Below is a code review of the old versions of the artifacts. Below that is my old code, my modified code, and their associated narratives.
