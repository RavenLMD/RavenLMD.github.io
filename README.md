## Self Assessment

### My time in the computer science program has allowed me to hone my strengths and develop new skills which align with my goals in the field of computer science. The program introduced me to applied subjects such as computational visualization, machine learning, data visualization, and cyber security.  The stated examples are areas which I have pursued at length beyond their original courses, and which have helped shape my goals toward ones of data science for research and of cyber security for offensive security. These subjects relevant to data science have allowed me to develop a functional and theoretical understanding of many of the computational concepts required to be successful in the career of research.

### These data science concepts, by necessity, required developing a deep understanding of theoretical computation, allowing for the development of an intuitive understanding of the most important data structures and algorithms in computation. My focus on cyber security aided with this, as defensive and offensive security both require deep understandings of data structures and algorithms in order to prevent attacks or exploit programs respectively.
                
### Throughout this journey, I learned much more than applied and theoretical computational concepts. Over these years of study, it became imperative to advance my collaboration skills to be able to succeed in a team environment. Working with others improved the readability and extensibility of all of my projects, as it was required for effective collaboration and communication. Because of this, I am now able to easily resume work on old projects because of the effort put into developing work in a way which easily communicates ideas to anyone working on said work. Additionally, it has been easy for those with whom I have worked to work with and modify my programs.

### In order to more effectively collaborate with others, I have often employed the agile scrum methodology, keeping development orderly, incremental, and well planned.

### In developing these communication skills, I also developed skills relevant to communicating with share holders, learning how to efficiently turn business goals into code, and communicating about any gaps or inconsistencies in requested outcomes.

### The computer science program involved a large amount of software engineering practice, which has been applied at length in my previously mentioned engagements with computational visualization, machine learning, data visualization, and cyber security, the first three of which required a well developed understanding of databases, in order to have efficient and effective data solutions.
